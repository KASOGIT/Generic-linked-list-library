## History

After creating this library for personal use I decided to share it.</br>
This library allows you to create a generic list as an object.</br>
It then accesses the library functions in this way: listX-> funcX (list, param1, paramX);</br>
I really think that the object-oriented C allows for better code organization during development but also readability when using.
